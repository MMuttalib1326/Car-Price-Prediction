# Car-Price-Prediction
In this Project, we will learn Linear Regression and real time challenges during implementation for a business problem.

One of the main areas of research in machine learning is the prediction of the price of cars. It is based on finance and the marketing domain. It is a major research topic in machine learning because the price of a car depends on many factors. Some of the factors that contribute a lot to the price of a car are:

Brand
Model
Horsepower
Mileage
Safety Features
GPS and many more.
